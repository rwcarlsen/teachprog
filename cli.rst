Command Line Interface
=======================

It is a program that runs programs.  You type in commands, and it runs
programs accordingly and prints the results to the screen.

Terminal Concepts:

  * File System: the terminal provides access to data stored on the
    computer's file system.  Generally, data are grouped into "files" that
    each have a unique handle consisting of textual characters called a
    "file path".  It is often convenient to think of a file system as a
    hierarchy of folders+files where slashes "/" in the file handle act as
    delimiters for subfolder (stored within) relationships.

    - Working directory: the "location" that all terminal commands are
      executed from.

  * Environment
